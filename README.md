# Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer created using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. The timer calculates and displays the time remaining until a specified release date/time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daniel3356/countdown.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Set the release date/time by updating the `release_unix` variable in the script section of the HTML file. Replace the value with your desired release date/time in Unix timestamp format.

```javascript
// Set the release date/time in Unix timestamp format
let release_unix = 1709599118; // Replace with your desired release date/time in Unix timestamp
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styles in the HTML and CSS to match your preferences. The `updateCountdown` function handles the countdown logic, and you can modify it further if needed.

```javascript
// Example: Change font size
$("#countdown").css("font-size", "2.5em");
```
